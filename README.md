## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (x64)
- No runtime install. Everything needed is inside the EXE (targets .NET Framework 4.8, which ships with every supported Windows release).

## Download

```
winget install killerpdf
```

- Prebuilt binary: <https://github.com/SteveTheKiller/KillerPDF/releases/latest/download/KillerPDF.zip>
- Source (GPL3 corresponding source for this release): <https://github.com/SteveTheKiller/KillerPDF/releases/download/v1.4.0/KillerPDF-1.4.0-src.zip>

## Build from source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SteveTheKiller/KillerPDF.git
cd KillerPDF
dotnet publish -c Release
```

Output lands in `bin/Release/net48/publish/`. The publish step produces a single Costura-bundled `KillerPDF.exe` plus a versioned `KillerPDF-<version>-src.zip` for GPL3 source distribution.

Requires the .NET 8 SDK or later to build (even though the output targets .NET Framework 4.8).

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Why this exists

I hate Adobe. Acrobat is bloated, tries to hijack file associations, wants a subscription to do basic things, and phones home constantly. Most of the "free" alternatives are either ad-riddled, cloud-based, or rebrands of the same PDF engine sold under three different names.

KillerPDF is what I wanted: local-only, portable, no account, no telemetry. The PDF equivalent of Notepad.

## License

GPLv3. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). If you fork, modify, or redistribute KillerPDF, your version must also be released under GPLv3 with source available. No exceptions for commercial rebrands.
